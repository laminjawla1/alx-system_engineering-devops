**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage - Duration: 3 hours (UTC), Impact: 25% of Users**

**Issue Summary:**
The outage occurred from 02:00 to 05:00 UTC, affecting 25% of our users. During this time, the main web application experienced slowdowns and intermittent unavailability, leading to a degradation of user experience.

**Timeline:**
- *02:00 UTC:* Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating increased response times.
- *02:05 UTC:* Engineering team initiated investigation into the root cause.
- *02:30 UTC:* Assumed the issue might be related to a recent code deployment, focused on recent changes.
- *03:00 UTC:* Identified a potential database bottleneck, leading to further investigation into database queries.
- *03:30 UTC:* Misleading assumption - focused on optimizing database queries but did not resolve the issue.
- *04:00 UTC:* Escalated the incident to the DevOps and Database teams for a more comprehensive analysis.
- *04:30 UTC:* Root cause identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer affecting routing to backend services.
- *05:00 UTC:* Issue resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
*Root Cause:* The root cause was traced back to a recent update in the load balancer configuration, leading to inefficient routing of traffic to backend services. This misconfiguration resulted in increased response times and intermittent unavailability.

*Resolution:* The issue was resolved by rolling back the recent load balancer configuration update and applying the correct settings. This correction allowed for proper distribution of incoming requests to backend services, restoring normal operation.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
*Improvements/Fixes:*
1. **Load Balancer Configuration Review:** Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations before and after updates to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
2. **Monitoring Enhancement:** Improve monitoring alerts to promptly detect anomalies in system performance, allowing for quicker response to potential issues.

*Tasks to Address the Issue:*
1. **Load Balancer Configuration Audit:** Perform a comprehensive audit of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any discrepancies.
2. **Incident Response Training:** Conduct training sessions for the engineering team to enhance incident response skills and promote quicker issue resolution.
3. **Documentation Update:** Update documentation to include a checklist for load balancer configuration changes, ensuring proper procedures are followed during updates.
4. **Post-Deployment Testing:** Implement a more robust post-deployment testing process to catch configuration errors before they impact the live environment.
5. **Communication Protocol:** Establish a clear communication protocol for incident escalations, ensuring timely involvement of relevant teams to expedite issue resolution.

In conclusion, the web stack outage was a result of a misconfiguration in the load balancer, leading to degraded performance for a subset of users. Swift detection, escalation, and a focused investigation ultimately led to the identification and correction of the root cause, preventing further impact. The corrective measures and tasks outlined aim to fortify our systems against similar incidents in the future, reinforcing our commitment to delivering a reliable and seamless user experience.
